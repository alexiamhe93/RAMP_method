# Repeated Adjustment of Measurement Protocols (RAMP) suppplementary materials

This repository contains data for use alongside the article titled:

*The Repeated Adjustment of Measurement Protocols (RAMP) method for developing high-validity text classifiers*

The repository contains:

1. Supplementary materials A: The RAMP method codebook used for manual coding.
2. Supplementary materials B: The non-iterative method codebook used for manual codebook.
3. A Python notebook for replicating results (created using Google Colab).
4. All data required for replication.

*NOTE* The notebook was designed on Google Colab and can be run using the free GPU (Nvidia T4). However, it does require a Google account. The code will also work offline although it would require installing all the packages *used* in the notebook (not just the ones installed by the notebook). To open in colab, simply click on the notebook file and in the left hand corner, a small button should say "open in colab". The code and models are all downloaded directly into the notebook, so there should be no need to run/download anything locally.
